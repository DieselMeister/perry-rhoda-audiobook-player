The Audioplayer currently working only on Android. I haven't implemented the audio player wrapper for iOS, yet. Nor do I own any apple devices. So community, go! 

The WPF Application is more or less only a way to test some basic functions without the long running compiling process for the android emulator.

Also there is currently no way to set the directory were the file will be stored.
